👋 Bonjour, I’m Rémi.

I’m Director, Web Development at [Mirego](https://www.mirego.com/en) in Quebec City, Canada.

I enjoy (among other things) 🏗 open-source code, 🥪 sandwiches, 🍺 craft beer, 📸 mobile photo, 🎧 hip-hop, the 🧀 Green Bay Packers, ⛲ Wikipedia… and emoji.

My [personal website](https://exomel.com/en) has more information about me.
