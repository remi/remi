I enjoy writing code, deploying Web applications and helping development teams build high-performance and maintainable digital products, using the best possible practices, patterns and tools.

I also enjoy (among other things) 🏗 open-source code, 🥪 sandwiches, 🍺 craft beer, 👨‍👩‍👧 my family, 🎧 hip-hop, ⛲ Wikipedia… and emoji.
